# DECA Development Kit

The DECA Development Kit presents a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera MAX 10 FPGA, which is the industryâ€™s first single chip, non-volatile programmable logic devices (PLDs) to integrate the optimal set of system components. Users can now leverage the power of tremendous re-configurability paired with a high-performance, low-power FPGA system. Providing internally stored dual images with self-configuration, comprehensive design protection features, integrated ADCs and hardware to implement the Nios II 32-bit microcontroller IP, MAX10 devices are ideal solution for system management, I/O expansion, communication control planes, industrial, automotive and consumer applications. The DECA development board is equipped with high-speed DDR3 memory, video and audio capabilities, Ethernet networking, and much more that promise many exciting applications.
